# DATA-Research-Application
This is a collection of all the data I've collected and visualizations I've created for my application. The assignment instructions and requirements are listed in LAB_ASSIGNMENT.pdf.

The given data file is lab_assignment.csv within the 'Data_Files' folder. All other data files were wrangled and created by me.

The final .py code file is in the 'Code' folder. To run the .py files, all of the data files must be in the same directory/folder on your local system as the .py file.
